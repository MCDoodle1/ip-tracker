## Overview

IP Address checker that uses the IP Geolocation API by IPify and Leaflet maps. Created with help of React, HTLM and Sass/CSS.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

I started writing the HTML to define the App structure. Then I defined what was needed in React to make a functioning App. I learned how to implement the Geo location API and how to link it to the maps. I wrote the react code. Then I implemented Sass and wrote the CSS. I made the App fluid and responsive with CSS/Sass code I used earlier in other projects. 

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Responsive design with fluid typography
- [BEM](https://en.bem.info/methodology/css/) - BEM Methodology
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) - Sass documentation


### What I learned

I learned more about working with API's in React and how to link data from the API to maps in Leaflet. I also learned how to hide an API key. I also continued learning about structuring CSS with Sass.

### Continued development

In a next project I want to extend my knowledge of React, learn more about semantic HTML and assistive technology like screen readers. I want to extend my knowledgde of CSS and Sass.
